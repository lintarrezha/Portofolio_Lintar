      <p>
        Hello, I'm Lintar Rezha! I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in <span className="font-semibold">Fullstack web development </span> and <span className="font-semibold">Frontend developer </span>while
        learning about new technologies.
        <br />
        <br />I am a student of Informatics Engineering at <span className="font-semibold">Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang (UMM)</span> and I am currently in the process of developing my skills in developing web applications, creating UI/UX
        designs, and striving to create quality code.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding I also like to exercise, such as Gym, Badminton, Billiard, Mini soccer, and many others. Because I think exercising is a way to maintain discipline and focus, values that I also apply in every project. My dream is
        to be an innovative web developer, able to create solutions that are beneficial to many people.
      </p>
